### A template backend using Go and MongoDB!

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/EricMarcantonio/go-mongo-starter)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/EricMarcantonio/go-mongo-starter)

After using MongoDB and Golang as backend solutions, I find myself writing boilerplate code. Here is the solution!

- [x] [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [ ] Dockerfile - Coming soon

Gin is an amazing framework for Go. Have some fun and test it with [k6](https://github.com/loadimpact/k6)!
